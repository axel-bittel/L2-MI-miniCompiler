# L2-MI-miniCompiler
miniC compiler

This is a project for the 6th semester of an IT Bachelor's degree program.
This project aims to create a compiler for a subset of the C programming language called miniC. The compiler will take miniC code as input and generate an intermediate representation in the form of graphs using the DOT graph description language.
